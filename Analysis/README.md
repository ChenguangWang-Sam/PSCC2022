# What are these files about?
- Code for analysing the generations.
    * Box-plots
    * Pearson correlation coefficient matrices
    * Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
    * Autoencoder-based test
    * Energy test

# Input
- Generated load data in the "Generations" folder.

# Note
- "Box plots" is the analysis code for Fig.2. in the PSCC2022 paper.
- "Pearson correlation coefficient matrices" is the analysis code for Fig.3. (b), (c), (d) in the PSCC2022 paper.
- We use Fig. 4. (a), (e) and (i) as examples for Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Autoencoder-based test, Energy test, respectively. The inputs of these tests can be changed to do the rest analysis in Fig. 4. You can find inputs from folder "Generations".
